Front|Mafia
=======
This is a web site about one of Adalab's group from Fairfax class. It shows group and individual information about each one making focus on their strenghts.

The main focus of this project is to show the entire group like an able front-end developers.

In addition, the main goal is to introduce them to the job market so it has a contact form to get in touch with Front|Mafia group.

The whole web site has been developed by the group, and is their first project as team together. We hope you can enjoy it! :)

We have used:
* HTML and Sass
* Mediaqueries and other responsive design techniques so that the web adapts to the screen size of different devices
* Accessibility labels
* Git and GitHub Pages to control project versions

The web has two pages:
* A home page (Home) with the main information about the team
* A contact page with a form so they can get in touch with you (you can also contact us by LinkedIn!)
